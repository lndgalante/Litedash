Should you replace Lodash with modern JavaScript?
It depends. On what you would ask ?

- You are using only a few Lodash modules.
- You are not using composition since it could gave you a better looking and manteinable code.
- You want to reduce the payload.
- You want to achieve more simplicity.
- You want less library dependencies.
- You want to gave it a try to Ramda (but thats' for another talk)
- You are aiming modern browsers and/or Node.js > 6
